# OctoAcme Project Management Processes

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management documentation. Our processes provide structure, clarity, and repeatability for cross-functional teams delivering product features, services, or integrations. The project lifecycle follows a proven path: **project initiation** (validating business needs, aligning stakeholders, and defining success metrics), **actionable planning**, **iterative execution**, **structured release**, and **continuous improvement**. Each phase is anchored by key artifacts such as the Project One-pager, Risk Register, Release Plan, and Retrospective notes, ensuring documentation and learnings are captured throughout.

**Roles and responsibilities** are clearly defined to promote accountability and effective collaboration. Project Managers (PMs) coordinate delivery, manage risks, and facilitate communication, while Product Managers focus on defining outcomes and prioritizing the backlog. Developers implement features, maintain quality, and participate in reviews, with QA/testing roles ensuring that acceptance criteria are met. Stakeholders provide input and approvals at critical junctures. This separation of responsibilities encourages informed decision-making and efficient execution across all project stages.

**Key workflows** center around the use of project boards (e.g., GitHub Projects) to track progress through stages such as Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, QA, and Done. Pull request (PR) conventions require small, reviewable changes, clear acceptance criteria, and automated testing before merging. Risk management is ongoing, with regular updates to the risk register and defined escalation paths for blockers, ensuring that issues are surfaced and addressed promptly. Communication is structured through regular cadences: daily standups for the team, weekly syncs for delivery and risk review, and monthly updates for stakeholders.

**Quality assurance and continuous improvement** are embedded throughout our process. Testing requirements include unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, as well as security scanning and manual QA when necessary. Templates for status updates, incident communications, and retrospectives ensure consistency and transparency. Retrospectives drive continuous improvement through actionable follow-ups and a culture that values learning and iterative enhancement. This comprehensive approach ensures that every project delivers value while building institutional knowledge for the future.
